a. Do any of 1-pt, 2-pt, or uniform crossover seem to perform better than the alternatives?
During my testing, I found that my 1-pt crossover would tend to survive longer, and evolve to
go further, faster. Uniform crossover would take much longer to find the shape the cars would converge
into.

b. How much does mutation seem to matter, and how sensitive are things to the mutation rate?
For single point crossover, mutation would not seem to affect the convergence that much, even at
a 5% rate. Generally the cars would find their shape to converge to pretty fast and the mutation would
not stray from the shape and performance of the car easily. The most helpful mutation would tend to be the third
wheel being added for the distance, and a wheel being removed for the duration the car survived.

c. Elite selection is included and has a default value of 3. If you alter this value do things 
tend to improve, get worse etc.?
If I would lower the elite selection value to 2, it would converge faster but, should I have gotten
an unlucky scenario where ALL the cars performed poorly (<0.5 distance) the children would stay that
way for much longer and it would take a long time for mutation to break away from the duplications of
the poorly designed cars. If I raised n, scenarios like the one above would be solved much faster, as
generally there was a much more broad selection of car types to splice together.
